Fixing the connection problem of database .SQLExpress with asp.net MVC for VT Part8 project 
Looks like it's failing trying to open a connection to SQL Server.
You need to add a login to SQL Server for IIS APPPOOL\ASP.NET v4.0 and grant permissions to the database.
In SSMS, under the server, expand Security, then right click Logins and select "New Login...".
In the New Login dialog, enter the app pool as the login name and click "OK".
You can then right click the login for the app pool, select Properties and select "User Mapping". 
Check the appropriate database, and the appropriate roles. I think you could just select db_datareader and db_datawriter, 
but I think you would still need to grant permissions to execute stored procedures if you do that through EF. 
You can check the details for the roles here.

Fixing Execute method deniel from the SQL Management studio for asp.net MVC VT part 11 project
just go to security -> schema -> dbo. Double click dbo, then click on permission tab -> (blue font)view database permission and 
feel free to scroll for required fields like "execute". Choose grant or deny controls.
